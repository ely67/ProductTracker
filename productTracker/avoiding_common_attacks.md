# Avoiding Common Attacks

The "Product Tracker Contract" has been designed with security in mind to mitigate common vulnerabilities and attacks. Below are some of the measures taken to ensure the contract's resilience to common threats:

## Access Control

### OnlyOwner Modifier

- The contract employs the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to critical functions such as adding, modifying, and removing products. Only the owner, initially set during contract deployment, can perform these actions. This prevents unauthorized users from manipulating the contract's state.

## Function Input Validation

### Check for Existing Products

- The contract checks if a product with the same product code already exists before adding a new product. This helps prevent duplication of product codes and ensures that products remain unique.

### Check for Existing Products (Modify and Remove)

- When modifying or removing a product, the contract checks whether a product with the given product code exists. This ensures that only valid product codes are used, reducing the risk of errors and unauthorized actions.

## Use of Structs and Mappings

- The contract efficiently organizes data using a `struct` to represent products and a mapping to store them. This design reduces the risk of data corruption or unauthorized access to product information.

## Events for Transparency

- The contract emits events like `ProductAdded`, `ProductModified`, and `ProductRemoved` to log important actions on the blockchain. These events provide transparency and allow users to monitor contract activity.


By implementing these security measures and best practices, the "Product Tracker Contract" aims to minimize the risks associated with common attacks, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the product tracking system.
