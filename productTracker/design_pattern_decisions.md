# Design Pattern Decisions

The "Product Tracker Contract" demonstrates several design patterns and best practices commonly used in Ethereum smart contract development. Below are some of the key design patterns and decisions made in this contract:

## Structs for Data Organization

- The contract uses a `struct` named `Product` to represent the properties of each product. This allows for efficient organization and retrieval of product data. Structs are a common design pattern in Ethereum contracts for grouping related data.

## Use of Mapping

- The contract uses a mapping `mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;` to store product information. The product code serves as the key, which enables fast and direct access to product data using its unique identifier. Mapping is a common data structure used in Ethereum contracts for efficient data storage.

## Access Control with Modifiers

- The contract defines a custom modifier `onlyOwner` that restricts certain functions to be callable only by the owner of the contract. Modifiers are a design pattern for access control and are used to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

## Events for Logging

- The contract emits events such as `ProductAdded`, `ProductModified`, and `ProductRemoved` when key actions are performed. Events are a design pattern for logging important contract actions and making them accessible to external systems.

## Constructor for Initialization

- The contract includes a constructor function to set the initial owner of the contract when it is deployed. Constructors are commonly used to initialize contract state upon deployment.

## Efficient Data Storage

- The contract uses efficient data storage techniques by deleting products when they are removed and keeping track of the total product count. This helps optimize gas usage and storage costs.



These design patterns and decisions contribute to the overall structure and functionality of the "Product Tracker Contract" and are commonly employed in Ethereum smart contract development for security, efficiency, and maintainability.
